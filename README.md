Hi, I’m Lukas!

My background is in political science and I'm interested in using what I learn by studying R to explore topics like democratization, corruption and elections

I’m currently working with R, but may begin learning Python soon.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project, follow and send me a message on Twitter!
